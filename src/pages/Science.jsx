                                Hydrology is the scientific study of water, focusing on its occurrence, distribution, movement, and properties on Earth and other planets. 
                                It examines the interaction between water and the environment, including its influence on ecosystems, weather, and human activities. 
                                The hydrological cycle applies to all water on earth, which covers an area of â€‹â€‹approximately 1.386 billion kmÂ³.
                                Hydrology causes liquid water to be found in bodies of water, such as oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, streams, canals, ponds, or puddles.

                                Water is fundamental to sustaining life, ecosystems, and the planet's overall balance. 
                                However, human activities, pollution, 
                                and mismanagement of water resources have caused significant environmental impacts. 
                                Below is a deeper dive into how water interacts with and influences the environment, 
                                both positively and negatively.
